# CODSOFT – Java Programming Internship

This repository contains Java programs developed as part of the
CodSoft Java Programming Virtual Internship.

The objective of this work is to apply core Java concepts by building
small but meaningful console-based applications with original logic
and structured design.

## 📌 Tasks Implemented

### Task 2: Student Grade Calculator
A console-based program that accepts marks for multiple subjects,
calculates total marks and average percentage, and assigns a grade
based on defined evaluation criteria.

### Task 3: ATM Interface
A simulated ATM system designed using object-oriented principles.
It allows users to deposit money, withdraw funds, and check account
balance with proper input validation.

### Task 4: Currency Converter
A Java application that converts currency values from one currency
to another using exchange rates. The program supports user input,
conversion logic, and formatted output.
